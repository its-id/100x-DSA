## Conditional Statements in C++

C++ has three types of conditional statements:

1.  **if-else statement**

    ```cpp
    if (condition_1) {
    // Executed if condition_1 is true
    } else if (condition_2) {
    // Executed if condition_1 is false and condition_2 is true
    } else {
    // Executed if both condition_1 and condition_2 are false
    }
    ```

2.  **switch statement**

    ```cpp
    switch (expression) {
    case constant_1:
        // Executed if expression is equal to constant_1
        break;
    case constant_2:
        // Executed if expression is equal to constant_2
        break;
    default:
        // Executed if expression is not equal to any constant
    }
    ```

3.  **conditional operator**

    ```cpp
    (condition) ? expression_1 : expression_2;
    ```

    Example:

    ```cpp
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
    cout << "Max: " << max;
    ```
