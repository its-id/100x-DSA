## Data Types in C++

- C++ is a strictly typed language, which means that every variable must have a specific data type.
- Generally, Data types can be categories in three types:

    1. **Primitive Data Types**: These are the basic data types that are built into the C++ language. Eg: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, etc.
    2. **Derived Data Types**: These data types are derived from the primitive data types. Eg: `Array`, `Pointer`, `Reference`, etc.
    3. **User-defined Data Types**: These data types are defined by the user. Eg: `Structure`, `Union`, `Class`, `Enumeration`, etc.
