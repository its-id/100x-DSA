## Arrays in C++

- Collection of elements is called an array.

- Since C++ is strictly typed, all elements in an array must be of the same type.

- Each array element is accessed by its index. For eg: `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, etc.

- The index of the first element in an array is `0`.

---

### Declaring an Array

- The syntax to declare an array in C++ is as follows:

  ```cpp
  data_type array_name[array_size];
  ```

  - `data_type` is the type of elements in the array.

  - `array_name` is the name of the array.

  - `array_size` is the number of elements in the array.

<br>

- Example:

  ```cpp
    int arr[5];
  ```

  - In the above example, we have declared an integer array `arr` with 5 elements.

---

### Initializing an Array

- You can initialize an array at the time of declaration as follows:

  ```cpp
  data_type array_name[array_size] = {value1, value2, ..., valueN};
  ```

  - `value1`, `value2`, ..., `valueN` are the initial values of the array elements.

<br>

- Example:

  ```cpp
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  ```

  - In the above example, we have declared and initialized an integer array `arr` with 5 elements.

---

## Accessing Array Elements

- You can access the elements of an array using the index.

- The index of the first element in an array is `0`.

- The syntax to access an array element is as follows:

  ```cpp
  array_name[index];
  ```

  - `array_name` is the name of the array.

  - `index` is the position of the element in the array.

<br>

- **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  cout << arr[0]; // Output: 1
  cout << arr[1]; // Output: 2
  cout << arr[2]; // Output: 3
  cout << arr[3]; // Output: 4
  cout << arr[4]; // Output: 5
  ```

  - In the above example, we have accessed the elements of the array `arr` using their indices.

---

## Looping Through an Array

### Syntax

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
    // Access array elements using index i
}
```

- In the above syntax, `i` is the index of the array elements.

- The loop runs from `0` to `array_size - 1`.

- You can access the array elements using the index `i`.

<br>

### Example

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Dynamic Arrays (Vectors)

- In C++, you can use the `vector` class from the Standard Template Library (STL) to create dynamic arrays.

- By dynamic arrays, we mean arrays whose size can be changed as per the elements added or removed.

- To use vectors, you need to include the `<vector>` header file.

- The syntax to declare a vector is as follows:

  ```cpp
  vector<data_type> vector_name;
  ```

  - `data_type` is the type of elements in the vector.

  - `vector_name` is the name of the vector.

<br>

### Example 1:

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> vec;
```

- In the above example, we have declared a vector `vec` that can store integer elements.

- The size of the vector is 0 initially.

### Example 2:

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

In the above example, we have declared and initialized a vector `vec` with 5 integer elements.

### Example 3:

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> vec(5, 10);
```

In the above example, we have declared a vector `vec` with 5 elements, each initialized to the value `10` i.e.,

- The size of the vector is 5.

- The elements of the vector are `10, 10, 10, 10, 10`.
