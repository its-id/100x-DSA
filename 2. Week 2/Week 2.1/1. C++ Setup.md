## Option 2: Using an Online Compiler

Best Compiler to run the C++ code online are: [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) or [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/ide).

## Running a C++ Program

1. Open a text editor and keep the following code in it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    //YOUR CODE HERE

    return 0;
}
```

2. Save the file with a `.cpp` extension. For example, `hello.cpp`.

<br>

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

<br>

4. Run the following command to compile the code.

   ```bash
   g++ hello.cpp -o hello
   ```

   <summary><b>Explaining above command</b></summary>

   The above command creates an executable file named `hello` from the `hello.cpp` file. Here is what each part of the command does:

   - `g++` is the compiler used to compile C++ code.
   - `-o` is an option that specifies the name of the output file.
   - `hello` is the name of the output file.

   </details>

   <br>

5. Run the following command to execute the code.

   ```bash
   ./hello.out # For Linux and Mac
   ./hello.exe # For Windows
   ```

6. You should see the output of the code in the terminal.
