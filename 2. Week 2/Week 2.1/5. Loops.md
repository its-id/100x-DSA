## Loops in C++

Similar to JS, C++ also supports two types of loops: `for` and `while`.

## For Loop

The syntax of the `for` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

- `initialization`: It is executed only once when the loop begins. It is used to initialize the loop variable.

- `condition`: It is evaluated before each iteration. If it is `true`, the loop continues. If it is `false`, the loop terminates.

- `update`: It is executed after each iteration, also known as _stepping statement_. It is used to update the loop variable.

Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Exiting early

You can exit the loop early using the `break` statement. Ex ðŸ‘‡

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

### Skipping an iteration

You can skip an iteration using the `continue` statement. Ex ðŸ‘‡

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    cout << i << " ";
}
```

## While Loop

The syntax of the `while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:

```cpp
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
}
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Do-While Loop

The syntax of the `do-while` loop in C++ is as follows:

```cpp
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

<details>
<summary><b>Explaining above syntax</b></summary>

- The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop. **But**
- The `do-while` loop executes the code block before checking the condition.
- So, the code block will be executed at least once.

Example:

```cpp
int i = 1;
do {
    cout << i << " ";
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
```

Output:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```
