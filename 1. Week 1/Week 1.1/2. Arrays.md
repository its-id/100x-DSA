## Arrays

- Collection of elements of the same type or different types (based on programming language).

### Declaration

- For shortly typed languages like C++, we need to specify the type of elements in the array.

  ```cpp
  //C++ Code
  int arr[5]; // Array of 5 integers
  int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array of 5 integers with values
  int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Array of 5 integers with values
  ```

  ```js
  //JS Code
  let arr = [];
  arr.push(1);
  arr.push(2);
  ```

- For dynamically typed languages like Python, we can store any type of element in the array.

  ```python
  # Python code
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

    <br>

  > In **Dynamic Typed Language**, It determines the type of the variable at runtime. For eg: It will throw error at runtime for operation `10 + "20"`. However, in statically typed language, it will throw error at compile time.

### Dyanmic Size Array in C++

- In C++, we can use `vector` to create a dynamic size array.

  ```cpp
  //C++ Code
  vector<int> arr;
  arr.push_back(1);
  arr.push_back(2);
  ```

### Accessing Elements

- We can access elements using the index of the element.
- Index starts from 0.
  ```cpp
  //C++ Code
  int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  cout << arr[0]; // 1
  cout << arr[1]; // 2
  ```

### Time Complexity

- Accessing an element in an array is O(1).
- Inserting an element at the end of the array is O(1).
- Inserting an element at the beginning of the array is O(n).
- Inserting an element at the middle of the array is O(n).
- Deleting an element at the end of the array is O(1).
- Deleting an element at the beginning of the array is O(n).
- Deleting an element at the middle of the array is O(n).
- Searching an element in an array is O(n) (Linear Search) but can be reduced to O(logn) for sorted arrays (Binary Search).
