## Strings

- collection of characters.
- list/array of characters.
- As it is a list of chars, we can perform same operations as we do on arrays.

### Declaration

- In C++, we can declare a string using `string` class.

  ```cpp
  //C++ Code
  string str = "Hello";
  ```

- In JS, we can declare a string using `let` keyword.

  ```js
  //JS Code
  let str = 'Hello';
  ```

### Some Important Points

- In some languages (ex: Python, Java), **strings are immutable** even if arrays are not immutable.
  <br>
- Whenever you get a string problem, try determining the possible set of characters. For example, if it is only lowercase or uppercase english alphabets, there are only 26 of them. If all characters (Extended ASCII) are allowed there are 256 of them.
