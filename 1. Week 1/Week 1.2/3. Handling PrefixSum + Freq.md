## Handling PrefixSum + Frequency Array Problems

- Often we are given problems around ranges.

- For eg: Given a Question [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-population-year/description/).

- We can solve these problems using PrefixSum and Frequency Array.

    <summary><b>Brute Force Soln</b></summary>

  - Iterate through all the possible years.
  - For an year, iterate through the list of ranges and see if the person is alive for that year. If yes, add 1 to the count.
  - Keep track of the maximum count and the year.

  - These problems are known as `Range Intersection problems`.

    <summary><b>Optimization 1</b></summary>

    - Sort the list of ranges based on the birth year.
    - Iterate through the list of ranges and keep track of the number of people alive at that year.
    - Keep track of the maximum count and the year.

    <summary><b>Optimization 2</b></summary>

    - Maintain a frequency array for the years, where freq[i] = number of people alive in year i.

    - To populate this array, we can iterate through the range of years and increment count for each year in the range:

          ```md
          freq[2051] = {0}

          for [birth, death] in persons {
              for (year -> birth to death) freq[year] += 1
          }
          ```

    </details>

    <br>

    <summary><b>Final Optimization</b></summary>

    - We can optimize the above approach by using PrefixSum.
    - We can calculate the PrefixSum array for the frequency array.

    - Psuedo code:

      ```python
      freq[2051] = {0}
      prefixSum[2051] = {0}

      for [birth, death] in persons {
          freq[birth] += 1
          freq[death] -= 1
      }

      for i in 1 to 2050 {
          prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + freq[i]
      }
      ```

    - Now, we can find the year with the maximum number of people alive by iterating through the prefixSum array.
